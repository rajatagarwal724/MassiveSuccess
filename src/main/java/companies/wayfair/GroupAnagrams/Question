QUESTION - 2 Autocomplete Prototype

Complete the implementation of an autocorrect function. Given a search query string,
the function should return all words which are anagrams.
Given 2 arrays, words[n], and queries[q], for each query,
return an array of the strings that are anagrams, sorted alphabetically ascending.

Note: An anagram is any string that can be formed by rearranging the letters of a string.
Example
n = 4, q=2
words = ["duel", "speed", "dule", "cars"],
queries = ["spede", "deul"]

The only anagram of "spede" is "speed".
Both "duel" and "dule" are anagrams of "deul".
Return [["speed"], ["duel", "dule"]].
