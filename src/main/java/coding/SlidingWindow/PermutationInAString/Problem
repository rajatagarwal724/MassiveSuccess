Permutation in a String

Problem Statement
Given a string and a pattern, find out if the string contains any permutation of the pattern.

Permutation is defined as the re-arranging of the characters of the string. For example, “abc” has the following six permutations:

abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba
If a string has ‘n’ distinct characters, it will have n! permutations.

Example 1:

Input: str="oidbcaf", pattern="abc"
Output: true
Explanation: The string contains "bca" which is a permutation of the given pattern.
Example 2:

Input: str="odicf", pattern="dc"
Output: false
Explanation: No permutation of the pattern is present in the given string as a substring.
Example 3:

Input: str="bcdxabcdy", pattern="bcdyabcdx"
Output: true
Explanation: Both the string and the pattern are a permutation of each other.
Example 4:

Input: str="aaacb", pattern="abc"
Output: true
Explanation: The string contains "acb" which is a permutation of the given pattern.
Constraints:

1 <= str.length, pat.length <= 104
str and pat consist of lowercase English letters.
