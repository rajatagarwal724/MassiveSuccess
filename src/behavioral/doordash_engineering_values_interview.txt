## Evaluation Pillars & Prep Framework
| Pillar | What the Interviewer Probes | Your Prep Checklist |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Relevant Experience** | Match between your past scope and DoorDash engineering challenges (scalability, latency, ownership of services, cross-team collaboration). | • Select 2–3 projects that mirror marketplace, logistics, data, or consumer-scale problems.<br>• Be ready to quantify impact (latency %, cost $, adoption %). |
| **Ownership** | Times you took responsibility end-to-end, drove decisions, and ensured success—even beyond your job description. | • Prepare a story where you identified a gap and led the fix.<br>• Highlight trade-offs, stakeholder alignment, and post-launch learning. |
| **Make Room at the Table** | Actions you took to create an inclusive, collaborative culture. | • Examples: onboarding plans, mentorship, advocating for quieter voices, improving review processes.<br>• Show measurable cultural impact (eNPS, retention, velocity). |
| **1% Better** | Continuous improvement mindset—for yourself and the product. | • Illustrate a habit of retrospectives, metrics, small iterations.<br>• Show personal growth plan (courses, reading, stretch projects) and how you uplift others. |
