# Payment Aggregator Integration System Design

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive system design for a platform that needs to integrate with multiple third-party payment aggregators. Payment aggregators are services that allow merchants to accept various payment methods (credit cards, digital wallets, bank transfers, etc.) without having to integrate with each payment processor individually.

## 2. Requirements Clarification

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

- Support integration with multiple payment aggregators (Stripe, PayPal, Adyen, Braintree, etc.)
- Process different payment methods (credit/debit cards, digital wallets, bank transfers, etc.)
- Support one-time payments and recurring subscription payments
- Handle payment authorization, capture, refunds, and chargebacks
- Support payment status tracking and reconciliation
- Provide webhook handling for asynchronous payment status updates
- Support international payments and multiple currencies
- Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Reliability**: 99.99% availability for payment processing
- **Security**: PCI DSS compliance, data encryption, tokenization
- **Performance**: Payment processing latency < 2 seconds
- **Scalability**: Support for peak transaction volumes (e.g., during sales events)
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful degradation when aggregators fail
- **Auditability**: Complete audit trail of all payment transactions
- **Consistency**: Ensure payment state is consistent even during failures

### 2.3 Extended Requirements

- Fraud detection and prevention
- Analytics and reporting capabilities
- Support for A/B testing between payment aggregators
- Cost optimization by routing payments through different aggregators
- Compliance with regional payment regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

## 4. Detailed Component Design

### 4.1 Payment Gateway Service

The Payment Gateway Service is the entry point for all payment requests:

- **API Layer**: Exposes RESTful APIs for client applications
- **Payment Method Selection**: Determines available payment methods based on context
- **Payment Routing**: Initial routing decision based on payment method, amount, currency, etc.
- **Security**: Implements authentication, authorization, and basic validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks

### 4.2 Payment Orchestrator

The Payment Orchestrator manages the payment workflow:

- **Transaction Management**: Creates and tracks payment transactions
- **Routing Logic**: Applies complex routing rules to select the optimal payment aggregator
- **Workflow Management**: Orchestrates the payment lifecycle (authorize, capture, refund)
- **Retry Management**: Implements retry strategies with exponential backoff
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures when aggregators experience issues

### 4.3 Aggregator Adapter Service

The Aggregator Adapter Service abstracts the specifics of each payment aggregator:

- **Adapter Pattern**: Standardized interfaces for different aggregators
- **Protocol Translation**: Converts internal request format to aggregator-specific formats
- **Configuration Management**: Manages API keys, endpoints, and aggregator-specific settings
- **Feature Mapping**: Maps internal feature requests to aggregator capabilities
- **Response Normalization**: Standardizes responses from different aggregators

### 4.4 Payment State Management

The Payment State Management service maintains the state of all payment transactions:

- **State Machine**: Implements a payment state machine (initiated, authorized, captured, failed, refunded, etc.)
- **Event Sourcing**: Records all payment events for auditability and recovery
- **Idempotency**: Ensures operations are idempotent to prevent duplicate transactions
- **Consistency**: Maintains consistent state even during system failures
- **Data Access Layer**: Provides access to payment transaction data

### 4.5 Notification Service

The Notification Service handles communication related to payment status:

- **Webhook Processing**: Processes incoming webhooks from payment aggregators
- **Event Publication**: Publishes payment events to interested systems
- **Notification Dispatch**: Sends payment notifications to users and internal systems
- **Retry Logic**: Implements retry for failed notifications
- **Delivery Guarantees**: Ensures at-least-once delivery of critical notifications
