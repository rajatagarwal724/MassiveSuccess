# Flight Booking System Design

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the system design for a scalable, reliable, and highly available flight booking platform similar to major Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like Expedia, Kayak, or airline-specific booking systems. The design covers all aspects from user search to booking confirmation, payment processing, post-booking management, and integrations with external airline systems.

## 2. Problem Statement

Design a flight booking system that allows users to search for flights across multiple airlines, compare prices and options, make bookings, manage their itineraries, and receive relevant notifications throughout their journey. The system should handle high traffic volumes, integrate with multiple external systems, ensure transaction integrity, and provide a seamless user experience.

## 5. System Architecture Overview

### 5.1 High-Level Architecture

The flight booking system uses a microservices architecture pattern with the following characteristics:

- **Service Decomposition**: Functionality is decomposed into independent, loosely coupled services
- **API-First Approach**: All services expose well-defined APIs
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services publish and subscribe to events for asynchronous communication
- **Polyglot Persistence**: Different data storage technologies are used based on service requirements
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures when external systems are unavailable
- **Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolate failures to minimize system impact

### 5.2 System Interaction Flow

1. **Flight Search Flow**:
   - User submits search criteria
   - Search service queries cache and/or GDS systems
   - Results are aggregated, filtered, and returned to user

2. **Booking Flow**:
   - User selects flight and enters passenger details
   - Booking service verifies availability with airline systems
   - User enters payment information
   - Payment service processes payment
   - Booking is confirmed with airline systems
   - Confirmation and e-tickets are sent to user

3. **Post-Booking Flow**:
   - User can view booking details
   - User can check in for flight
   - User receives flight status updates
   - User can modify or cancel booking (subject to airline policies)

### 5.3 Data Flow

The system processes several types of data flows:

1. **Flight Inventory Data**: From airlines to the search system
2. **User Data**: From users to the booking and account systems
3. **Transaction Data**: Between the booking, payment, and airline systems
4. **Notification Data**: From various services to the notification service
5. **Analytics Data**: From all services to the analytics system

### 5.4 Consistency and Transaction Management

The system employs a combination of strategies to ensure data consistency:

- **Two-Phase Commit**: For critical booking operations requiring strong consistency
- **Saga Pattern**: For long-running transactions across multiple services
- **Eventual Consistency**: For non-critical operations like analytics and recommendations
- **Optimistic Concurrency Control**: For handling concurrent booking attempts
- **Idempotent Operations**: To prevent duplicate bookings or payments

## 6. Key Design Considerations
