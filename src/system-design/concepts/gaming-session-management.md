## 5. Detailed Component Design

### 5.1 Session Service

**Responsibilities:**
- Create and manage game sessions
- Handle real-time session updates
- Persist session state
- Manage session lifecycle

**API Design:**
```java
// Session Management APIs
POST /sessions
GET /sessions/{sessionId}
PUT /sessions/{sessionId}/state
DELETE /sessions/{sessionId}
POST /sessions/{sessionId}/actions
GET /sessions/{sessionId}/events
```

**Session State Model:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "sess_12345",
  "playerId": "player_67890",
  "gameId": "game_abc",
  "state": {
    "level": 5,
    "position": {"x": 100, "y": 200, "z": 50},
    "health": 85,
    "inventory": ["sword", "potion", "key"],
    "score": 15420,
    "achievements": ["first_kill", "level_5"]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "device": "mobile",
    "version": "1.2.3"
  },
  "multiplayer": {
    "roomId": "room_xyz",
    "teammates": ["player_111", "player_222"]
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Real-time Communication

**WebSocket Architecture:**
```
Game Client ←→ WebSocket Gateway ←→ Session Service ←→ Game Engine
```

**Message Types:**
```json
// Player Action
{
  "type": "PLAYER_ACTION",
  "sessionId": "sess_12345",
  "action": "MOVE",
  "data": {"x": 105, "y": 205, "timestamp": 1642248000000}
}

// Game Event
{
  "type": "GAME_EVENT",
  "sessionId": "sess_12345",
  "event": "ENEMY_DEFEATED",
  "data": {"enemyId": "enemy_456", "xpGained": 100}
}

// State Sync
{
  "type": "STATE_SYNC",
  "sessionId": "sess_12345",
  "state": { /* full or partial state */ }
}
```

### 5.3 Session Storage Architecture

**Three-Tier Storage:**

**Tier 1: Active Session Cache (Redis)**
```
Purpose: Ultra-fast access for active sessions
TTL: 1 hour (extends on activity)
Data: Full session state
Partitioning: By session ID hash
```

**Tier 2: Session Database (MongoDB)**
```
Purpose: Persistent session storage
Schema: Document-based for flexible game state
Indexing: playerId, gameId, createdAt
Sharding: By playerId hash
```

**Tier 3: Analytics Store (Cassandra)**
```
Purpose: Historical session data and analytics
Schema: Time-series optimized
Partitioning: By (gameId, date, playerId)
Retention: 1 year
```

### 5.4 Session Consistency Model

**Consistency Levels:**
```
Critical State (Health, Position): Strong Consistency
- Synchronous writes to primary DB
- Confirmation before action completion

Non-Critical State (UI preferences): Eventual Consistency
- Asynchronous writes
- Cache-first updates

Analytics Data: Eventual Consistency
- Batch processing acceptable
- Focus on throughput over consistency
```

## 6. Scalability Strategies

### 6.1 Horizontal Scaling

**Session Service Scaling:**
```
Load Balancing Strategy: Consistent Hashing by sessionId
Auto-scaling: Based on CPU and memory usage
Stateless Design: All state in external stores
```

**Database Scaling:**
```
Redis Cluster: 
- Hash slot based partitioning
- 16,384 slots distributed across nodes
- Automatic failover with Redis Sentinel

MongoDB Sharding:
- Shard key: playerId (ensures player data co-location)
- Config servers for metadata
- Replica sets for each shard

Cassandra Cluster:
- Partition key: (gameId, date)
- Clustering key: (playerId, timestamp)
- Multi-datacenter replication
```

### 6.2 Caching Strategy

**Multi-Level Caching:**
```
L1 Cache: Application-level (in-memory)
- Session objects in service memory
- 1-minute TTL, LRU eviction

L2 Cache: Redis Cluster
- Distributed cache for session state
- 1-hour TTL, extends on access

L3 Cache: CDN (for static game assets)
- Game configuration, maps, assets
- Long TTL with versioning
```

### 6.3 Geographic Distribution

**Multi-Region Architecture:**
```
Regions: US-East, US-West, EU-West, Asia-Pacific
Strategy: Active-Active with regional affinity
Data Sync: Asynchronous replication for non-critical data
Latency Optimization: Route players to nearest region
```

## 7. Reliability and Fault Tolerance

### 7.1 High Availability Design

**Service Level:**
```
Deployment: Multi-AZ with load balancing
Health Checks: /health endpoint with dependency checks
Circuit Breakers: Hystrix for external service calls
Graceful Degradation: Fallback to cached state
```

**Data Level:**
```
Redis: Master-Slave with Sentinel for failover
MongoDB: Replica sets with automatic failover
Cassandra: Multi-node cluster with tunable consistency
```

### 7.2 Disaster Recovery

**Backup Strategy:**
```
Redis: RDB snapshots every 15 minutes
MongoDB: Continuous backup with point-in-time recovery
Cassandra: Daily snapshots with incremental backups
```

**Recovery Procedures:**
```
RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 15 minutes
RPO (Recovery Point Objective): 5 minutes
Cross-region backup replication
Automated failover procedures
```

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Authentication & Authorization
```
Session Token: JWT with 1-hour expiration
Refresh Token: Secure, HTTP-only cookie
Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC)
Device Binding: Tie sessions to device fingerprints
```

### 8.2 Anti-Cheat Measures
```
Server-Side Validation: All critical actions validated
Rate Limiting: Prevent action spamming
Anomaly Detection: ML-based cheat detection
State Verification: Periodic state consistency checks
```

### 8.3 Data Protection
```
Encryption: TLS 1.3 for data in transit
At-Rest Encryption: Database-level encryption
PII Protection: Hash/encrypt sensitive player data
Audit Logging: Track all session modifications
```

## 9. Monitoring and Observability

### 9.1 Key Metrics
```
Business Metrics:
- Active sessions count
- Session duration distribution
- Player retention rates
- Actions per session

Technical Metrics:
- API response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Database query performance
- Cache hit rates
- Error rates by endpoint

Infrastructure Metrics:
- CPU, Memory, Network utilization
- Database connection pools
- Queue depths
- Disk I/O patterns
```

### 9.2 Alerting Strategy
```
Critical Alerts:
- Session service down (>5% error rate)
- Database unavailable
- High latency (>100ms p95)

Warning Alerts:
- Cache hit rate <90%
- High memory usage (>80%)
- Unusual session patterns
```

## 10. Performance Optimizations

### 10.1 Session State Optimizations
```
Delta Updates: Send only changed state
Compression: Gzip session data
Batching: Group multiple actions
Lazy Loading: Load session data on-demand
```

### 10.2 Database Optimizations
```
Connection Pooling: Reuse database connections
Query Optimization: Proper indexing strategies
Read Replicas: Separate read/write workloads
Prepared Statements: Reduce parsing overhead
```
