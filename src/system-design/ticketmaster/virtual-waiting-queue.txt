# VIRTUAL WAITING QUEUE SYSTEM FOR HIGH-DEMAND TICKET SALES

## 1. INTRODUCTION

A virtual waiting queue is a critical component for high-volume ticketing platforms like Ticketmaster 
that manage high-demand events (concerts, sports events, etc.). 
The system is designed to handle traffic spikes that exceed system capacity while providing a fair, 
transparent, and efficient ticket purchasing process.

## 2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

### Functional Requirements
- Manage millions of concurrent users during high-demand sales
- Fair queue position assignment without preference (first-come, first-served)
- Dynamic admission control based on system capacity
- Real-time queue position updates and estimated wait times
- Session persistence across network/browser issues
- Prevention of queue-jumping and bot mitigation
- Support for priority queues (fan clubs, presales, etc.)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Horizontal scalability to handle 50M+ concurrent users
- High availability (99.99%+) during peak demand
- Low latency for queue status updates (<500ms)
- Data consistency across queue operations
- Observability with real-time metrics
- Graceful degradation during partial system failures

## 4. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Queue Data Structure

The queue uses a multi-tiered approach:

1. **Distributed Priority Queue**
   - Primary: Redis sorted sets with score = timestamp
   - Each queue node handles a subset of users (sharded by user ID)
   - Secondary: Backup in a durable store (Cassandra/DynamoDB)

```
// Redis Structure Example
ZADD queue_shard_1 1621234567.123 "user:token:8675309:signature"
ZADD queue_shard_1 1621234568.456 "user:token:1234567:signature"
// Get position
ZRANK queue_shard_1 "user:token:8675309:signature"
```

2. **Admission Control System**
   - Token bucket algorithm for controlling admission rate
   - Dynamic rate adjustment based on backend system load
   - Circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures

### Queue Token Design

```
Token = {
  userId: string,          // Hashed user identifier
  eventId: string,         // Event being queued for
  timestamp: long,         // Queue entry time (ms precision)
  position: long,          // Assigned queue position
  salt: string,            // Random value for uniqueness
  signature: string        // HMAC signature to prevent tampering
}
```

### Fairness Implementation

1. **First-Come First-Served Base Algorithm**
   - Timestamp-based ordering with millisecond precision
   - Clock synchronization across intake servers using NTP
   - Global sequence generator for tie-breaking

2. **Queue Position Integrity**
   - Signed queue tokens prevent manipulation
   - Server-side position verification on each request
   - Position binding to device fingerprint and user session

3. **Anti-Bot Measures**
   - Progressive challenge difficulty (CAPTCHA, etc.)
   - Behavioral analysis to detect automated patterns
   - Rate limiting based on IP and session attributes

### Waiting Room Implementation

1. **Client-Side Architecture**
   - SPA with offline capabilities using Service Workers
   - WebSocket connection for real-time updates
   - Local queue token storage with IndexedDB
   - Heartbeat mechanism to maintain position

2. **Server-Side Processing**
   - Stateless design for horizontal scaling
   - Event-driven processing with message queues
   - Batch processing for efficiency at scale

### Wait Time Estimation Algorithm

```java
public long estimateWaitTimeMinutes(long position, long currentAdmissionRate) {
  // Base calculation
  long estimatedWaitTime = position / currentAdmissionRate;
  
  // Apply dynamic factors
  double adjustmentFactor = calculateAdjustmentFactor();
  estimatedWaitTime = (long)(estimatedWaitTime * adjustmentFactor);
  
  // Apply historical correction based on ML models
  estimatedWaitTime = applyHistoricalCorrection(estimatedWaitTime, position);
  
  return Math.max(1, estimatedWaitTime); // Minimum 1 minute wait
}

private double calculateAdjustmentFactor() {
  // Factor in current system load
  double systemLoadFactor = getSystemLoadFactor();
  
  // Factor in historical dropout rate at current queue position
  double dropoutFactor = getHistoricalDropoutRate(position);
  
  // Factor in time of day and regional traffic patterns
  double timeOfDayFactor = getTimeOfDayFactor();
  
  return systemLoadFactor * dropoutFactor * timeOfDayFactor;
}
```

## 5. SCALABILITY STRATEGIES

### Horizontal Scaling

1. **Queue Sharding**
   - Partition queues by event ID and then by user ID hash
   - Consistent hashing for queue distribution
   - Local aggregation with global coordination

2. **Read/Write Separation**
   - Heavy read optimization with replicas
   - Write consolidation to minimize contention
   - Eventual consistency model for position updates

3. **Hierarchical Queue Management**
   - Global coordinators for cross-shard operations
   - Local managers for shard-specific operations
   - Tiered caching with cache-aside pattern

### Capacity Planning

1. **Queue Intake Capacity**
   - Support 100K+ new queue entries per second
   - Auto-scaling based on traffic prediction models
   - Regional capacity allocation based on event geography

2. **Active Queue Maintenance**
   - Support 50M+ concurrent queue participants
   - Position updates at 10-second intervals maximum
   - Graceful degradation to 30-second intervals under extreme load

3. **Admission Control**
   - Dynamically adjusted based on backend capacity
   - Configurable per event based on venue/inventory size
   - Gradual ramp-up to prevent system shock

## 6. FAILURE HANDLING & RESILIENCE

### Fault Tolerance

1. **Session Persistence**
   - Multi-region session replication
   - Graceful recovery from connection drops
   - Client-side token storage with reconnection logic

2. **Queue State Recovery**
   - Periodic queue state snapshots to durable storage
   - Write-ahead logging for queue operations
   - Reconciliation process for recovering from node failures

3. **Degraded Operation Modes**
   - Static waiting page fallback if dynamic updates fail
   - Cached queue positions if real-time system unavailable
   - Throttled admission with increased conservatism

### High Availability Design

1. **Multi-Region Deployment**
   - Active-active configuration across 3+ regions
   - Global traffic management with latency-based routing
   - Regional isolation for containing failures

2. **No Single Points of Failure**
   - Redundant components at every tier
   - Stateless services where possible
   - Independent failure domains

3. **Chaos Engineering Practices**
   - Regular failure injection testing
   - Regional evacuation drills
   - Queue migration exercises
